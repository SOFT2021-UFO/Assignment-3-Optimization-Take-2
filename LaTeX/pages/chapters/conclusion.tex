As we can see from our data, small changes to the code can result in HUGE improvements to the execution times, which further reinforces our statement, that it is important to research the methods you're going to use before writing the program.\\\\

Our data confirms that we reached an average performance gain of 56.30\%, which is greater than our goal of reaching at least 50\% optimization.
