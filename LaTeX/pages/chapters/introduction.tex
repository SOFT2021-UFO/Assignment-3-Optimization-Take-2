\section{The task}
Find a point in your program that can be optimized (for speed), for example by using a profiler.
Make a measurement of the point to optimize, for example by running a
number of times, and calculating the mean and standard deviation (see
the paper from Sestoft).
If you work on the letterfrequencies program, make it at least 50%
faster.

\section{Our solution}
We chose to optimize the program "LetterFrequencies" that were provided to us by the school. The program opens text file, counts all of the occurring letters in the file and then prints the result.\\\\
Our assignment were to optimize the programs performance with at least 50\%, which we achieved by replacing the programs "reader" with a "bufferedReader".
